## Compatibility with version 2.5

In Servlet 2.5, ``metadata-complete`` only affected the scanning of annotations at deployment time. The notion of web-fragments did not exist in Servlet 2.5. However in Servlet 3.0 and later, ``metadata-complete`` affects scanning of all annotations that specify deployment information and web-fragments at deployment time.
